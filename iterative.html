      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p>
        Iterative design is a powerful process involving prototyping, testing, 
        analyzing, and refining the product until a final design is created.
        We wanted to put this technique into practice by designing a web interface
        for Y-combinator startup <a href="https://startplaying.games/">StartPlaying.Games</a>,
        which aims to be an online marketplace for tabletop players to find games
        and/or game hosts. Unlike a traditional redesign, we wanted to create a
        design for this site without referencing the original website.
      </p>
      <h4>Sketching and Wireframing</h4>
      <p>
        After getting acquainted with the startup's purpose and goals, the first step was
        to create sketches of the main pages that would be required. Each member
        of our group came up with our own vision of what the site would look like
        and created a set of basic sketches.
      </p>

      <p>
        After coming up with our sketches, we got together to combine our ideas
        and create a final wireframe.

      <h4>Hi-Fi Iterations</h4>
      <p>
        With our lo-fi prototype in hand, we were then ready to create a hi-fi 
        mockup of the site. For the visual aesthetics, we envisioned a sleek design
        with a color palette comfortable among gamers. Thus, we primarily developed
        in dark mode, and used a single font throughout with varying sizes and
        weights for a cleaner look. To maintain a consistent look, we also choose
        to use a single highlight color, a light blue, to accent certain interface elements.
        Below is our first hi-fi iteration.
      </p>
      <iframe class="figma" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FctH8HpP3n06NNF6JQi1w8L%2FIterative-Design-Crit%3Fnode-id%3D1%253A161%26scaling%3Dscale-down" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <h4>Critique and Next Iteration</h4>
      <p>
        After finishing our first hi-fi prototype, we asked other students to
        give us feedback. We received a lot of constructive criticism on our
        design which allowed us to further improve our design. Some of the
        feedback we received is below:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Remove underlines on elements that are not clickable</li>
        <li>Have the name of the site in more places</li>
        <li>Use a primary call-to-action color</li>
        <li>Make it easier for users to book a game</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Using this feedback, we came up with another set of mockups. 
        Here is an example of a change we made - notice how we bumped up the 
        hierarchy of the "Book Now" call-to-action, and rearranged sections to 
        add more information about the game:

      </div>
      <p>
        Our improved prototype is shown below:
      </p>
      <iframe class="figma" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FDfjXAp0tvCbh9EX3XJ32bl%2FIterative-Design-Final-Ver-DnD%3Fnode-id%3D20%253A298%26scaling%3Dscale-down" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <h4>User Testing</h4>
      <p>
        With our much improved hi-fi design, we decided to take the prototype to
        <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">UserTesting.com</a>, a site where
        real users can interact with and give feedback on the usability of a prototype.
        We provided each user with testing instructions and asked them questions
        about the usability of our site.
      </p>
      <p>Testing Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Log into the website.</li>
        <li>Find a game to book.</li>
        <li>Book the game.</li>
        <li>Submit your game booking order.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Post-Testing Questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>What frustrated you most about this site?</li>
        <li>What feature would you like added to the website?</li>
        <li>What did you like about the site?</li>
        <li>How difficult did you find it to book a game on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being easy and 10 being very difficult?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        After gathering feedback from our user tests, we came up with the following
        changes to make in the future:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>On a host page, add a list of games the specific host is hosting 
          along with a “Book Now” option to streamline workflow for booking a game.</li>
        <li>Add a confirmation page after booking a game.</li>
        <li>Upcoming booked games should show the host's name for further clarity.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Takeaways</h4>
      <p>
        Creating a design completely from scratch and without using an existing
        design is defintely a unique experience. I felt that I had more freedom
        to experiment with different layouts and designs since I was making
        everything from scratch. I also learned about how powerful a tool iterative
        design and user testing are. I think our final design defintely would
        not have been as successful without going through different iterations
        of our hi-fi prototype and gathering feedback at each step in the
        process.
