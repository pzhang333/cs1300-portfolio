      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p>
        Visual design is a polarizing subject and is often subject to personal biases.
        However, there are times when we need to be able to defintely say
        "Design A is better than Design B." A/B testing and statistical analysis
        are powerful tools that can help us to determine which designs are better.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this experiment, I first created 2 versions of the same shopping site.
        Users of the website were given a single task: add 150 dollars worth of
        cacti to the shopping cart.
      </p>
      <h4>Forming Hypotheses</h4>
      <p>
        For this experiment, I was interested in 2 specific metrics. The first
        metric was <b>time to completion</b> and the other metric was
        <b>return rate</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After specifying which metrics I was interested in, I then created a
        hypotheses for each metric. In statistics, a hypothesis is actually
        composed of 2 things: a <b>null hypothesis</b> and an
        <b>alternative hypothesis</b>. A null hypothesis takes the position
        that there is no difference between versions A and B of our website,
        while an alternative hypothesis claims there is a difference.
      </p>
      <h5>Time to Completion:</h5>
      <p><b>Null:</b> There is no significant difference in time to completion between
      Site A and Site B.</p>
      <p><b>Alternative:</b> Time to completion will be shorter for Site B
      because the grid layout makes finding different items easier and therefore
      should reduce the time needed to complete the task.</p>
      <h5>Return Rate:</h5>
      <p><b>Null:</b> There is no significant difference in return rate between Site A
      and Site B.</p>
      <p><b>Alternative:</b> There is a difference in return rate between Site A
      and Site B because Site A highlights quantities and prices in red,
      which should reduce how often a user needs to check the cart to get the
      total price.</p>
      <h4>All About Data</h4>
      <p>
        The process of data collection can be split into 3 distinct parts.
        First, the actual collection of data. Next, the cleaning of data. And
        finally, the processing of our cleaned data.
      </p>
      <h5>Data Collection</h5>
      <p>
        To collect our data, we added listeners to each sites' buttons.
        When a button was clicked by a user, a new log line would be generated.
      </p>
      <h5>Data Cleaning</h5>
      <p>
        Once we have our raw logs, we need to clean our data. An example of a
        potential bad log is a user that loaded the site but did not interact
        with the site. These bad logs should be removed as they can skew our
        results.
      </p>
      <h5>Data Analysis</h5>
      <p>
        The final step is to analyze our clean data, which we do using our
        custom Python scripts. We can use the numerical outputs from our
        Python scripts to reach important conclusions.
      </p>
      <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>
        To present my results, I made a short infographic.
      </p>

      <h4>Takeaways</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Having a sufficient quantity of data is extremely important.
          With the relatively limited number of users in my data set, it is
          hard to get a statistically significant result. I think that if I had
          more users and thus more data, I might have been able to obtain different
          results.
        </li>
        <li>
          It will be easier to get statistically significant results
          using big design changes as opposed to smaller design changes.
          As a whole, the differences between my Site A and Site B definitely existed,
          but they were not drastic, which might explain why I did
          not obtain statistically significant results for either metric.
        </li>
        <li>
          Having a diverse pool of <b>new</b> users is important. Examining the data points
          individually, I found that most users had similar completion times. I
          hypothesize that part of this can be attributed to familiarity with the task.
          Since most students tested multiple websites, it would be very easy to memorize
          exactly how many plants of type D you need to add to the cart to reach 150 dollars.
          This skew the results since the users are not "new users". 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Although I am disappointed that I did not obtain statistically
        significant results for either of my metrics, I still found that this
        assignment was a great learning opportunity. I think A/B testing
        and statistical analysis are very important tools, and I will definitely
        use them in the future to analyze my designs.
