      <h4 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">The Problem</h4>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">
        The process of observing users interacting with an interface, interviewing these users,
        creating personas based on these users, and creating a storyboard based on a persona is
        a classic UX task. As a student of CS1300 (UI/UX), our first assignment was to experience
        this entire process to better understand our users.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">
        I chose my apartment's washing machine because I think it has a relatively complex and interesting interface. 
        I then asked a couple of close friends to use my washing machine so I could learn more about its interface.
        Since a washing machine is something I see and use everyday, I was interested to see what I could learn
        from watching others use mine.
      </p>
      <h4 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">The Interface</h4>
      <div class="center-children">
        <img data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true" class="responsive-img" src="personas/interface_sketch.png" alt="Interface">
      </div>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">
        This washing machine interface allows users to select and customize
        different preset clothes washing programs. Besides the basic components 
        present on all washing machines such as a door, a power button, etc., 
        the washing machine also provides a dial and a variety of buttons so that
        users can choose a specific program and then add additional secondary
        options to the selected washing program.
      </p>
      <h4 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">Observations</h4>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">
        I choose my users because I knew they had never interacted with this
        specific washing machine interface before. Therefore, I felt they would
        be able to give an unbiased viewpoint. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19
        restrictions, my choice of users was not as representative of the
        general user population as I would have liked.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">The following is a summary of my observations of my 3 different users.</p>
      <ol data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">
        <li>
          All three users hesitated when trying to turn the machine on. All three
          incorrectly pressed the power button multiple times. One user even 
          turned the machine off again while trying to turn the machine on.
        </li>
        <li>
          None of the users hesitated when adding soap to the laundry detergent
          compartment. They quickly opened the compartment and added the detergent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some users decided to change the washing program and adjust some of
          the additional options. Other users simply used the default program
          and started the machine after loading in their laundry.
        </li>
        <li>
          All three users did not hesitate when starting the washing cycle. None
          of them pressed the start button multiple times or accidentally paused
          the wash cycle. However, one user did have troubling pausing the wash
          cycle after starting it.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">Interviews</h4>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">
        The next step was conducting user interviews. I asked the following questions:
      </p>
      <ol data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">
        <li>
          Could you describe your experience using the washing machine?
        </li>
        <li>
          On the following scale, how would you rate your experience using the washing machine?
          <br>
          (1) Very Easy
          <br>
          (2) Easy
          <br>
          (3) Average
          <br>
          (4) Hard
          <br>
          (5) Very Hard
        </li>
        <li>
          Could you specifically comment on the interface of the washing machine?
        </li>
        <li>
          Could you compare this washing machine's interface to other washing machines
          you may have used in the past?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is there anything you found unexpected or confusing about the washing machine's interface?
        </li>
        <li>
          Are there any changes you would make to the washing machine's interface?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is there anything else you want to say about the washing machine
          that you did not get a chance to say earlier?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">
        I then interviewed each user.
      </p>
      <h5 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">User 1</h5>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">
        User 1 said they found the washing machine very difficult to turn on.
        They said the interface did not make much sense, and although the
        power button was clearly labeled, the fact that the button did not
        offer any tactile feedback made it impossible to tell if pressing
        the button had any result. User 1 said that other washing machines
        they have used in the past had much fewer options, but they thought
        this simplification made those interfaces more intuitive. User 1
        said to improve the interface of this washing machine, they would
        reduce the number of buttons present and would use buttons that
        provided tactile feedback.
      </p>
      <h5 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">User 2</h5>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">
        User 2 also said they found the machine difficult to turn on. Also,
        starting the wash cycle was easy, but pausing the machine was difficult
        as it required using a different keypress on the same button, which was
        unintuitive. They also said previous washing machines they have used
        had fewer features, but were also easier to use due to the simpler
        interface. User 2 said to improve the interface, they would either
        reduce the number of options on the machine or create a companion
        app that provided a fully interactive interface for the washing machine.
      </p>
      <h5 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">User 3</h5>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">
        User 3 found the machine unintuitive to start up and also found the
        graphic labels on the machine unclear. They said other washing machines
        they used had fewer options and were thus easier to use. Furthermore,
        they also found the grouping of options on the machine to be
        unintuitive. User 3 said they would change the start button to provide
        some kind of feedback, either visual or tactile, so that a user can tell
        if the machine is in the process of turning on. They would also change
        the grouping of buttons on the interface.

        Steve is a busy college student who doesn't have much time to spend on
        doing laundry. Steve is frustrated by all of the extra options on the
        washing machine that he doesn't use, but still needs to go through
        every time to start the wash cycle. This persona represents my users
        who didn't care about the specific washing program and just wanted to
        wash their clothes. They were frustrated by all of the extra options
        they didn't need.

        available on the machine, but is frustrated by how hard it is to
        actually use the machine and its options. This persona represents
        my users who took the time to carefully choose a washing program and
        were also frustrated with how difficult the machine was to actually use.

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">
        As someone with no formal UI/UX experience, I found this project to be really
        interesting. A washing machine is something people see and use everyday,
        so I didn't think I would learn much from watching other people use my
        washing machine. After all, how many different ways can you really use
        a washing machine?
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1200" data-aos-once="true">
        As it turns out, even something as simple as using a washing machine
        can be done very differently by different users. I found that I actually
        learned a lot of things that I would not have otherwise found out by 
        watching other people use my washing machine and then interviewing them.
        I think that going through this entire process has made me a better
        designer.
